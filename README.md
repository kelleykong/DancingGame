A Simplified Game on Bare Computer

==================================

It is a entry-level of OS Lab in my sophomore year. But it is interesting. Students can try to get any game they like.
But the game needs to run on a bare computer, which is just like old style games.

I implemented a dancing game. When arrows go up to overlap with arrows fixed on the top of screen, users need to press up, down, left, right these 4 buttons. When users succeed, the arrows will twinkle.

The .vdi is the final version of the compiled dancing game, which can be run as a hard disk on VirtualBox.
